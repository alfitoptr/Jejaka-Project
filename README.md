## Project Overview:
**Jejaka** is an application designed to help tourists easily discover attractions and explore the local culture of various destinations. Our recommendation system suggests attractions based on the user's **current location**. Additionally, we include recommendations for nearby lodging, restaurants, cultural sites, and hospitals to ensure users have all the essential information, making travel safer and more convenient.

The **Jejaka** application is crafted to provide a **seamless and efficient user experience**, with a clean interface for easy navigation.

## Key Features:
- **Tourist Attraction Recommendations**: Suggests attractions based on the closest location to the user.
- **Nearby Recommendations**: Displays nearby **lodging**, **restaurants**, **culture spots**, and **hospitals** for added convenience and safety.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: The recommendation system is built using **Content-Based Filtering** to personalize suggestions.
- **Data Scraping**: All data related to attractions, lodging, and other locations is gathered using the **Google Places API**.
